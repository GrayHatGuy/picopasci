## picoponicscan
 *  Central sensor monitor and control firmware for an economical and scalable hydroponic system.
 *  
 *  Reads air temp, humidity, VOC, CO2, Soil H2O, TDS, EC, and water temp.
 *  Sensor metrics will eventually be used as a feed forward mechanism for closed loop 
 *  control of lighting, mixing, irrigation, and air quality/HVAC.  
 *  
 *  additional libraries required for a successfull build:
