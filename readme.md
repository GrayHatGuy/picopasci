## picoponicscan 
Central sensor monitor and control firmware for an economical and scalable hydroponic system using an RP2040 pico and standard off the shelf sensors and components
 *  air temp
 *  humidity
 *  VOC
 *  CO2
 *  Soil H2O
 *  TDS
 *  EC
 *  water temp.
Next steps
 *  Sensor metrics will eventually be used as a feed forward mechanism for closed loop control of lighting, mixing, irrigation, and air quality/HVAC.  
## additional libraries required for a successfull build:
